# Contributing (WIP)

Contributions are always welcome! This includes suggestions for new features, changes in the direction
of the app, and anything in between. If you are looking to contribute, and feel something could be done
in a better way using something outside of the stack in this project, feel free to bring it up! We are by no
means tied down to Node/Express/EJS etc.. We just want to create the best stuff we can!

## Before you create a PRâ€¦
Please [create an issue](https://github.com/connorphee/league-app/issues) first to discuss your idea with the maintainer(s). After we've chatted things through, go ahead with your work and send over a PR.

## Branches
Please create a feature branch with your changes in the format: `[fix/feature/etc]/[description]` -- this helps to gauge what the branch is for later on.

## Prior To Submitting PR
Please run this command and be sure that your feature branch passes this prior to submitting the PR. No PR's will be merged or considered if this command does not pass.
`npm run eslint`
